Useful algorithms implemented in python 3.

---

This repository is a collection of:

 * useful algorithms implemented in python using the standard library only; 
 * sample applications used to demonstrate the use of important algorithms existing in the standard lib.

This is mostly intended as a self study and reference material in my journey to learn Python 
and not as production ready code; the test are also much more limited than I'd like to have in a real project.

I'd love if this can be useful to someone out there too, so please help yourself.
If you like it or, even more likely, if you find parts (or all) not being "pythonic enough" please let me know!
All of this is done to learn, so do not hesitate commenting. And be patient and foregiving ! ;)
